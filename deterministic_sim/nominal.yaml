# @Brian Liu's analysis says:
# 2506 students who are infected and recover from 12/22/2021 - 1/25/2022
# 965 arrival positives in the period 1/26/2022 - 2/7/2022 (not including arrival testing)
# In addition we have ~1900 infected during the outbreak
# Arrival testing scenario 1:
#   all students do a pre-departure antigen test with sensitivity 50%,
#   all students again an arrival PCR test with sensitivity 67% and no isolation delay,
#   then the chance of a positive getting through is .5*.33 = 0.165
#   This would give 2506 + (1-.165) 965 = 3312 immune and .165 * 965 = 160 infectious to start
#   Add 1900 immune to get 5212
# Arrival testing scenario 2:
#   half of students do a pre-departure test with sensitivity 50%,
#   75% of students (independently chosen) do an arrival PCR 67% sensitivity and no test delay
#   then the chance of a positive getting through is (.5 + .5*.5) * (.25 + .75*.33) = 0.37
#   This would give 2506 + (1-.37) 965 = 3114 immune and .37 * 965 = 357 infectious to start
#   Add 1900 immune to get 5014
