# @Brian Liu's analysis says:
# 2506 students who are infected and recover from 12/22/2021 - 1/25/2022
# 965 arrival positives in the period 1/26/2022 - 2/7/2022 (not including arrival testing)
# In addition we have ~1900 infected during the outbreak
# Arrival testing scenario 1:
#   all students do a pre-departure antigen test with sensitivity 50%,
#   all students again an arrival PCR test with sensitivity 67% and no isolation delay,
#   This would give 2506 + (1-.165) 965 = 3312 immune and .165 * 965 = 160 infectious to start
#   Add 1900 from the Dec Omicron surge to get 5212
# Arrival testing scenario 2:
#   half of students do a pre-departure test with sensitivity 50%,
#   75% of students (independently chosen) do an arrival PCR 67% sensitivity and no test delay
#   then the chance of a positive getting through is (.5 + .5*.5) * (.25 + .75*.33) = 0.37
#   This would give 2506 + (1-.37) 965 = 3114 immune and .37 * 965 = 357 infectious to start
#   Add 1900 immune to get 5014
# The google sheet below works out these numbers, and also the number of people who will need to be isolated from the
#   people infected over break with immunity that are not found in pre-departure testing and from the active infections
#   that are found in arrival testing

# For GR and Professional students past infections, we take the UG numbers, take out the 1900 from the Dec Omicron
#   outbreak and divide by 2.  This gives (5011-1900)/2 = 1555. Scaling by population size gives
#   1555 * 8000 / 16000 = 777 for GR and 1555 * 3000 / 16000 =  292 for professional students.
# For UG initial infections, we take the UG active infections, cut by 2, and scale by the population size.  This gives
#   (360 / 2) * 8000 / 16000 = 90 for GR and (360 / 2) * 3000 / 16000 = 34 for professional students.
# For faculty / staff, past_infections we take roughly 15 per day (roughly how many infections we've been seeing),
#   over 40 days to get 600. For active infections, we take 15 per day over 3 days
