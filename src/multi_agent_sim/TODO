    * need to debug code
    * currently assuming no false positives
    * introduce realistic quarantine / isolation dynamics
    * think through long-term-maintainable structure for the top-level step() function
        * where should quarantine decisions happen?  in the top-level function or within individual components?  we should be consistent in how we address this, to avoid future confusion.
    * maybe want to think through more sophisticated rules for triggering adaptive testing
